# Water-depth-estimation
This repository includes code for the paper: VGG16、ResNet、GoogleNet、EfficientNet、SE-ResNet、CBAM-ResNet、CA-ResNet.
All of these models in the repository can assess the rating of flood images.
## CA-ResNet
This study tried to add Coordinate Attention (CA) into ResNet, and proposed CA-ResNet to acquire the global submerged water depth.The proposed CA-ResNet method was compared with VGGNet, ResNet, GoogleNe, and EfficientNet, the CA-ResNet model exhibits superior performance.In order to evaluate the effect of adding different attention mechanisms to ResNet. This study investigate the effect of attention modules on the pre-trained model ResNet by incorporating two different attention mechanisms, SENet, and CBAM, into the ResNet network and performing them in the same experimental context and setting.
